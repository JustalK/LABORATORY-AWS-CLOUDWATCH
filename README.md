# LABORATORY-AWS-CLOUDWATCH

This laboratory is a tutorial/example how to use winston to register log in the AWS Cloudwatch. For this laboratory, I have used **NX** to create my workspace, **Express.js** to create an API, **Winston** as a logger and **Winston-cloudwatch** library to make the connection.
